# Samuel_Dartey_Baah_and_Paa_Kwesi_Atobrah_Final_AI_Sleep_Quality_Prediction_Project
This is an AI deep learning model which predicts a person's sleep quality and how to improve it.
This AI model can be used to predict how well or not an individual will possible sleeps by using certain characteristics to determine this probability. 
It uses MLP to train, GridSearchCV to tune the model. These are the functionalities

A model is trained, tuned and deployed with streamlit to build a web app

The web app takes in inputs from the necessary features: ['Stress Level', 'Sleep Duration', 'Age', 'Heart Rate', 'Physical Activity Level', 'Daily Steps', 'Diastolic', 'Systolic', 'BMI Category_encoded'] from the user.

It then predicts a sleep quality rating out of 5 based on the answered features and gives personalised ways one can improve their sleep quality

streamlit run app.py should be run to in app.py terminal
